# How to Enable the Season Selector (For Future Seasons)

This guide explains how to change the website from being locked to Season 1 to allowing users to select any season defined in your `config.js` file.

When you're ready to allow users to switch between seasons, you'll only need to make two small edits in `utils.js`.

---

## Step 1: Update the `getCurrentSeason` Function

This change will make the website remember the user's selected season in their browser, instead of always forcing Season 1.

1.  Open the `utils.js` file.
2.  Find the `getCurrentSeason` function.
3.  **REPLACE** the current function:

    ```javascript
    // This is the OLD function that forces Season 1
    function getCurrentSeason() {
        console.log('Inside getCurrentSeason. Forcing S01 for all interactions.');
        const forcedSeason = 'S01'; 
        localStorage.setItem('selectedSeason', forcedSeason); 
        console.log('getCurrentSeason returning (forced):', forcedSeason);
        return forcedSeason;
    }
    ```

4.  With this **NEW** version:

    ```javascript
    // This is the NEW function that gets the last selected season
    function getCurrentSeason() {
        // Gets season from browser memory, or defaults to 'S01' if nothing is set.
        // This makes Season 1 the default for first-time visitors.
        return localStorage.getItem('selectedSeason') || 'S01';
    }
    ```

## Step 2: Update the `createSeasonSelector` Function

This change will unlock the dropdown menu and automatically populate it with all the seasons you have configured in `config.js`.

1.  In the same `utils.js` file, find the `createSeasonSelector` function.
2.  **REPLACE** this block of code:

    ```javascript
    // This is the OLD code that disables the dropdown and only shows "Season 1"
    selector.disabled = true; // Make the selector unclickable

    // Manually add only the 'S01' option
    const option = document.createElement('option');
    option.value = 'S01'; // The internal key for Season 1
    option.textContent = 'Season 1'; // What the user sees
    selector.appendChild(option);

    selector.value = 'S01'; // Ensure the single option is selected
    ```

3.  With this **NEW** block of code:

    ```javascript
    // This is the NEW code that enables the dropdown and shows all seasons
    selector.disabled = false; // Enable the dropdown

    // Dynamically create options for all seasons in config.js
    const seasons = Object.keys(SEASON_CONFIGS).sort(); // Get all season keys (e.g., "S01", "S02")
    seasons.forEach(seasonKey => {
        const option = document.createElement('option');
        option.value = seasonKey;
        // Makes 'S01' appear as 'Season 1', 'S02' as 'Season 2', etc.
        option.textContent = `Season ${parseInt(seasonKey.substring(2))}`;
        selector.appendChild(option);
    });

    selector.value = currentSeason; // Set dropdown to the currently active season
    ```

After saving these two changes in `utils.js`, your season selector will be fully active and functional!
